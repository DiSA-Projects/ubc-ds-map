## Overview

The Learning Design & Digital Innovation (LDDI) unit supports the design, development and deployment of innovative teaching practices in the **Faculty of Education**.

LDDI is a hub of innovation and creativity, and is here to help instructors create engaging learning experiences for their students. We do this by supporting instructors with new learning technologies, and with curriculum and instructional design.

Our goal is to enable quality instruction in classroom, blended, and distance modalities, and we offer workshops and training focused on technology-enhanced teaching and learning. The LDDI team helps instructors think creatively and push the boundaries using new tools, or new ways of applying tools and resources, so that they can get the most impact from their teaching.
