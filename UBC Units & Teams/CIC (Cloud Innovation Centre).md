## Overview

The UBC Cloud Innovation Centre (CIC) at the University of British Columbia (UBC) is a collaboration with Amazon Web Services (AWS), and opened in January 2020. It is the first of its kind in Canada, and provides UBC students with unique work-integrated learning opportunities.

The UBC CIC supports student/staff teams tackling real-world issues and challenges, where application of novel and emerging technology or computing approaches are essential. Challenge projects may be proposed by UBC faculty, staff, students and community partners. Projects will generally take between 10-16 weeks.

In April 2024, the UBC CIC announced a new focus on Generative AI. Prior to that time, the UBC CIC largely focused on community health and wellbeing projects contributing to a variety of challenge themes in support of community access to water; better medical diagnostics; improved patient care; harm reduction for students; AI for analysis of curriculum; fostering research collaboration, and more.

### Expression of Interest

The Expression of Interest is the first stage of the process; if needed, we will collaborate with Challenge Sponsors to further develop the ideas, to assemble teams and/or to stream projects to other programs if this one is not suitable.  
  
All proposed projects must have the potential to contribute to the common good
