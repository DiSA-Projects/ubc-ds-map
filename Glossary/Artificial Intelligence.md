Artificial Intelligence (AI) is technology that enables computers and machines to simulate human learning, comprehension, problem solving, decision making, creativity, and autonomy. AI takes on various forms and applications.  

For researchers in the humanities, there tend to be four main applications of interest: [[Machine Learning]], [[Natural Language Processing]], [[Computer Vision]], and [[Generative AI]]


## Policies & Guidance on AI Tool Use 

Before integrating AI tools into your research process, we strongly recommend reviewing current policies on AI use in research, innovation, and documentation. 

UBC has strict guidelines both at the university and department level around the use of GenAI for academic writing and research. National and international research organizations (NSERC, SSHRC, CFI) also have their own guidelines.
