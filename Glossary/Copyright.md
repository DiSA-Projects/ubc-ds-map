Copyright is created and governed by the Canadian ‘[‘Copyright Act](http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/c-42/) _and Canadian court decisions. Canada is a party to various international copyright treaties, which have been implemented by the_ Copyright Act_, and which influence court decisions._

When any person creates an original “work”, the law of copyright automatically governs who has the right to produce, copy, perform, publish, adapt, translate or telecommunicate that work.

The term “work” means

- any literary, artistic, dramatic and musical work,
- a computer program,
- a translation of a work,
- a compilation of others’ works,
- a recording of any kind, and
- a performance of a work.

Generally (but not always), the author of the work is the copyright owner – and that person is said to hold or own the copyright in the work. In other words, they have the right to control if and how the work will be produced, copied, performed, etc.

The rights of the copyright owner, however, are subject to certain user rights, which permit members of the general public to copy, perform etc. works in certain limited circumstances, without the copyright owner’s knowledge or permission.

## Public Domain

Works that no longer attract copyright protection are said to be in the public domain, and you are free to use them without restriction. That includes no restrictions on copying and adapting, no need to seek permission, and no uncertainty about your rights as a user. There is also no legal requirement to attribute works in the public domain to their creators, although doing so is an important part of maintaining [academic integrity](https://learningcommons.ubc.ca/understand-academic-integrity/).

#### Public Domain in Canada

Effective December 30, 2022, the copyright for a work created in Canada will usually expire 70 years following the end of the calendar year in which the creator died.  However, for works where the last living author died on or before December 31, 1971, the previous copyright term (of 50 years after the end of the calendar year in which the author died) still applies.  Works that already entered the public domain prior to the enactment of the copyright term extension under the _Copyright Act_ will remain in the public domain.

Please refer to the charts here:

## Orphan Texts

"Orphan texts" refer to works with unlocatable copyright holders that are still technically covered by copyright law. These might include out-of-print work from presses or publishers who no longer exist and whose authors are deceased or unknown.  This category also includes work for which no current contact information information for any potential copyright holder (publisher or author) can be located.

Because Canadian copyright law now extends 70 years past the date of the creator's death and copyright can be transferred, many creative works cannot be digitized for public access or study.

At the moment, researchers must file a request with the Copyright Board of Canada for a "non-exclusive license" for the use of these works.

Standard turnaround is 45 business days and will grant you license to use the work for a specified period of time (not in perpetuity). There will likely be a royalty to be paid

https://cb-cda.gc.ca/en/unlocatable-owners
