Open education addresses barriers to learning by engaging in open education practices in the classroom and through the development and use of open educational resources.**

Open practice engages students in collaborative knowledge creation that are then openly shared through networked technologies. Open education resources are teaching and learning resources made freely available through the public domain or open copyright licenses.
