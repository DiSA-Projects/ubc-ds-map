Data visualization is the graphical representation of information and data using visual elements like charts, graphs, maps, and infographics to make complex data understandable; reveal patterns, trends, and outliers; and facilitate data-driven decisions. Data visualization helps turn numbers into accessible stories for both technical and non-technical audiences.
