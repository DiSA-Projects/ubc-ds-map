[D]igital scholarship [is] a general term for research that encompasses digital publishing, data visualization, the digital humanities, data science, and data analysis—all of which utilize digital collections, tools, and methods. Digital scholarship, broadly defined, uses digital content and tools to pursue research and interpretation with the goal of furthering knowledge. While this work can take many forms, one common strand is that it makes use of the powers of computing to do things that may not have been possible otherwise. From intensive analysis of data sets, to the collaborative sharing of resources or projects across networks, to experiments in artificial intelligence, digital scholarship takes advantage of the speed, scale and reach that computers bring to information technologies--both within and across traditional disciplinary boundaries.

Digital Scholarship is a discipline that encompasses a whole host of activities including but not limited to digital publishing, text data mining, mapping, digital exhibitions and collections, programming, and visualization. The term is often used in connection with Digital Humanities, a field focused on bringing digital tools to humanistic inquiry. Digital Scholarship, however, is viewed as a broader subject that is discipline-agnostic.
