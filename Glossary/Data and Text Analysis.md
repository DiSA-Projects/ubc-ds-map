Data and text analysis involve using computational methods (like [[Natural Language Processing]]) to extract meaningful patterns, insights, and knowledge from large volumes of unstructured text, and transforming it into "actionable information" ready for tasks like [[sentiment analysis]], [[topic modeling]], and [[trend discovery]]. 

Data and text analysis is a subset of [[data mining]].

## Relevant Python Libraries

### Text Analysis

* [[NLTK]]: The Natural Language Toolkit offers stemming, tokenization, lemmatization, parsing, and sentiment analysis ([website](https://www.nltk.org/))
* [[spaCY]]: industry-scale NLP library written in Cython. Offers plugins that integrate with your machine-learning stack to build custom workflows ([website](https://spacy.io/))
* [[TextBlob]]: provides a simple API for common NLP tasks such as parts-of-speech tagging and sentiment analysis. Features include n-grams, word inflection, lemmatization, spelling correction, and WordNet integration ([website)](https://textblob.readthedocs.io/en/dev/)
* [[Scikit-learn]]: Supports popular machine-learning algorithms, including linear and logistic regression and random forests. It offers tools to transform data and build custom ML models ([website](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/))

### Data Analysis and Data Visualization
* [[Pandas]]: Important library for data manipulation and analysis, includes data structures like Series (1D) and DataFrame (2D, like spreadsheet). ([website](https://pandas.pydata.org/))
* [[NumPy]]: Known for high-performance, multi-dimensional array object (ndarray) more efficient than a Python list for numerical operations. Enables fast mathematical operations, linear algebra functions, statistical computations, and efficient handling of large numerical datasets ([website](https://numpy.org/))
* [[Matplotlib]]: A powerful [[Python]] library for creating a vast array of static, animated, and interactive data visualizations. ([website](https://matplotlib.org/))
* [[Seaborn]]: Popular Python library for statistical data visualization built as a high-level interface on top of [[Matplotlib]] ([website](https://seaborn.pydata.org))
