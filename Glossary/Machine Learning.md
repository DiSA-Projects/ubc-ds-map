Algorithms that can learn patterns from training data, then make inferences about new data.

Machine learning (ML) is a subset of [[Artificial Intelligence]] focused on algorithms that can "learn" the patterns of [[training data]] and, subsequently, make accurate inferences about new data. Fundamentally, ML is about creating a [[pattern recognition model]] and using it to make decisions, predictions, or recommendations based on how the new data fits within the patterns it identifies. 

[[Large Language Models (LLMs)]] rely on the patterns discovered in large language datasets and use them to predict or generate responses and/or new text.
