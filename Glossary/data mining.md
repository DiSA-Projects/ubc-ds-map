Data mining is the process of extracting insights from large datasets using statistical and computational techniques. It can involve structured, semi-structured, or unstructured data stored in databases, data warehouses, or data lakes. The goal is to uncover hidden patterns and relationships to support informed decision-making and predictions using methods like clustering, classification, regression, and anomaly detection.
