Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a subfield of [[Artificial Intelligence]] that enables computers to understand, interpret, and generate human language. 

NLP uses [[Machine Learning]] and other techniques to analyze text and speech and powers applications like chatbots, voice assistants, search engines, and tools for automating business tasks.  

## Key Techniques

* **Tokenization** (breaking text into small pieces like words or subwords)
* **Stemming and Lemmatization** (reducing words to their root or dictionary form)
* **Stop Word Removal** (removing common words that are not significant)
* **Parsing** (analyzing a sentence’s grammar to identify parts of speech)
