A digital exhibit is an online collection of curated content designed to tell a story, showcase research, or present historical and cultural materials. An exhibit might include digital images of traditional exhibition objects, such as scans of maps, letters, or photographs of paintings, or digital media such as sound files or videos.

Digital exhibits can be more flexible than physical exhibits, as they can bring together objects that might not be loaned to a physical exhibits, display objects that would be otherwise not shown due to conservation concerns or physical constraints, and offer elements of interaction and multimedia that might be too complicated to create in a physical space.
