Deep-learning models that can generate high-quality text, images, and other content based on the data they were trained on. 

These models take in a large amount of raw data and "learn" to generate statistically probable outputs when prompted. 

Essentially, generative models encode a simplified representation of their training data and, using it as a guide, produce new work that's similar, but not identical, to the original.
