## Overview

Globus is a secure and reliable research data management service. Using Globus, you can quickly transfer data between your local computer, Sockeye, Chinook, and many research computing endpoints worldwide.

## Using Globus

Globus offers two primary user interfaces, the [Globus web interface](https://app.globus.org/) (file manager) and the [Globus Command Line Interface (CLI)](https://docs.globus.org/cli/). The web interface provides a clickable, graphical interface for managing files. The CLI provides an interface to Globus services from the shell, and is suitable for both interactive and simple scripting use cases.

Globus also provides an [API](https://docs.globus.org/api/) and [Python SDK](https://globus-sdk-python.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) for programmatic access.
