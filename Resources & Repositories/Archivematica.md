## Overview

The persistent digital collections implementation plan developed for UBC Library consists of using the open-source Archivematica digital preservation system to provide preservation functionality for the Library's digitized and born-digital holdings. This [project report](http://diginit.sites.olt.ubc.ca/files/2012/07/UBCLibrary-PersistentDigitalCollectionsPlan-ProjectReportCondensed-1.pdf#file) describes the plan in detail.

Digital objects produced at the Digitization Centre will be processed through the system to enable long-term management of the resources. Archivematica integrates with our access systems to ensure that preservation will be part of the standard workflow of providing access to our collections.
