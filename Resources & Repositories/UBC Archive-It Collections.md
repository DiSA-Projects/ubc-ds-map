## Overview

UBC Library has had a consortial subscription with Archive-it through [COPPUL](https://coppul.ca/) (Council of Prairie and Pacific University Libraries) since 2013 and uses this subscription to archive important web content for UBC researchers and the community. Links to UBC's archived web pages can be found on our [Archive-It public page](http://archive-it.org/organizations/734).


## About Archive-It

[Archive-It](https://archive-it.org/) is a web archiving service from the [Internet Archive](https://archive.org/) that UBC Library has used to collect and access past web pages since 2013. It works to capture and preserve dynamic web pages while also being a platform for institutions/partners to share collections to allow for research, discovery, and accessibility. You can read more about Archive-it's history and projects [here](http://archive-it.org/blog/learn-more/).
