## Overview

UBC ARC Chinook is an object storage platform, available to UBC researchers by application.

With an initial 5 PB of storage, Chinook is an integral part of UBC’s efforts to significantly increase storage capacity to meet the immediate needs of UBC researchers and supplement the storage resources available through the national research computing platforms.

The Chinook platform can be used to retain and retrieve portions of large research datasets composed of files and unstructured data, such as short or medium-term archives, collection and aggregation of results, copies of valuable datasets, staging of reference datasets or nearline storage. Chinook easily integrates with UBC ARC Sockeye, our high-performance computing cluster, for fast and convenient data transfer to the compute platform.

Chinook storage is accessed via [Globus](https://globus.org/) for data transfer and data sharing and optionally [S3](https://arc.ubc.ca/chinook#s3).

## Who Can Apply

UBC Faculty members and Principal Investigators (i.e., deemed Principal Investigator by a Dean or UBC affiliated institution) can apply for Chinook allocations through the online application form. Applicants can have only one active allocation; however, access can be granted to multiple users, including external collaborators. Applications can be submitted on an ongoing basis.

Priority will be given to Faculty members who are:

- New to UBC 
- Early-career researchers; or that
    - Have research data that must be stored on-site or cannot be accommodated by any other existing computational resources (e.g. Compute Canada). 

Use of the system is contingent on acceptance of the [UBC ARC Chinook Terms of Service](https://arc.ubc.ca/sites/default/files/documents/TOS-Chinook-TermsOfService.pdf "TOS-Chinook-TermsOfService.pdf").
