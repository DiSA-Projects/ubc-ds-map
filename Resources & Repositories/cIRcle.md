## Overview

cIRcle is UBC's open access institutional repository for published and unpublished material created by the UBC community and its partners, including faculty, students, and staff. Its aim is to showcase and preserve UBC’s unique intellectual output by making content freely available to anyone, anywhere.

UBC is committed to developing a system for making UBC research accessible in open access repositories and cIRcle is part of this strategy. The Senates of UBC Vancouver and UBC Okanagan have both endorsed [UBC’s Open Access Position Statement](https://scholcomm.ubc.ca/open-access/ubc-position-statement/) which encourages faculty to deposit their research in cIRcle. In October 2021, the [Librarian and Archivist Statement of Commitment to Open Scholarship](https://scholcomm.ubc.ca/home/librarian-statement-of-commitment-to-open-scholarship/) was launched to highlight the aspirational goals and professional activities supporting open scholarship across the UBC Vancouver and Okanagan campuses.
