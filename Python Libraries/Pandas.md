Pandas is an open-source software library built on top of the [[Python]] programming language, specifically designed for data manipulation and analysis. It provides high-performance, easy-to-use data structures and data analysis tools that make working with structured data (like spreadsheets and lists) much more intuitive and efficient.

Pandas is used for data loading and writing, data cleaning, manipulation and transformation, grouping and aggregation, and time and date data. The library integrates well with other Python libraries ([[NumPy]], [[Matplotlib]], [[Scikit-learn]])
