## Overview

**Digital Scholarship in Arts (DiSA)** is a hub for knowledge exchange, fostering collaboration, and cultivating a community of Arts researchers engaged in [[Digital Scholarship]]. DiSA is an initiative from the [[Dean of Arts Office]] that aims to broaden and enhance embedded computational and software support for researchers in the [[Faculty of Arts]], and stimulate faculty and graduate training opportunities. Expanding the possibilities of [[Digital Scholarship]] in the [[Humanities]], [[Social Sciences]], and [[Creative and Performing Arts]] helps researchers leverage [[digital technologies]] to reach new potentials in their academic work.

## Partnerships

We are a collaborative initiative started by the [[PHH (Public Humanities Hub)]], [[Arts ISIT (Arts Instructional Support and Information Technology)]] and the [[Research Commons (UBC Library)]] focused on Faculty of Arts research and scholarship using digital methods.
