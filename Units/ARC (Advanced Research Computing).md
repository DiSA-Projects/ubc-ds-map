## Overview
ARC is UBC's institutionally dedicated service for researchers across all disciplines working on questions that have large data and computational needs.  

Following the introduction of [Sockeye](https://arc.ubc.ca/compute-storage/ubc-arc-sockeye) and [Chinook](https://arc.ubc.ca/compute-storage/ubc-arc-chinook), ARC has grown the research services it offers. Through training, consultation, research proposal support, hosting survey platforms, and offering commercial cloud computing infrastructure, ARC is constantly evolving to meet the needs of UBC’s leading researchers.   

In addition to ARC's systems and support, the unit partners with the [Digital Research Alliance of Canada](https://www.alliancecan.ca/en) (the Alliance) to ensure UBC researchers have continued access and assistance to leverage the national [[Digital Research Infrastructure (DRI)]].  Through training, consultation, research proposal support, hosting survey platforms and offering commercial cloud computing infrastructure, ARC is constantly evolving to meet the needs of UBC's leading researchers.  

ARC's services are provided free-of-charge to the UBC community.
