## Overview

The **Public Humanities Hub (PHH)** fosters innovative, collaborative public humanities research and advances public-facing, accountable scholarship in the Humanities across Arts, Law, and Education at UBC. The PHH supports new directions in humanities scholarship for scholars and projects, through grants, faculty fellowships, SSHRC Connection grant support, graduate mentoring, and public programming, including academic events and toolkits to build humanities community and research capacity. The PHH prioritizes public engagement, making high-brow cultural artifacts more accessible while fostering accountable academic collaboration. It seeks to reimagine knowledge creation, redistributing access to diverse publics, especially digital scholarship and historically marginalized communities.
